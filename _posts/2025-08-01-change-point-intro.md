When you collect data for a long enough time, the data-generating process will inevitably change. The mean might shift, the variance might shrink. _Change points_ are where these changes occur. 

Failing to incorporate _change points_ into an analysis risks producing spurious inference. In other words, we risk making false conclusions. Research in _change point analysis_ is focused on extending the statistical repertoire to handle distribution shifts to produce valid statistical inference. 

Change points are present in a wide variety of applications, but their primary use is with biomedical and economic/financial data. Stock prices are collected every second of every day, but market conditions change constantly. Over time, laws get passed and policies get enacted. Each of these can trigger a bull run or a recession. We cannot accurately study these time-series without considering the distribution shifts.
