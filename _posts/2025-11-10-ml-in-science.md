## Machine Learning in Modern Science

**Science has been transformed by prediction models**. Tedious tasks can be automated at scale. Machines can count cells on a plate without complaint. Machines can read terabytes of astronomy data and never blink. What used to take a lifetime to process can now be done in an afternoon. 

But like most innovations, machine learning doesn't just allow us to do more of what we've done before, they allow us to do _different_ things. We're not just annotating images faster, we're not just predicting responses more accurately. The confluence and synergy of technologies has allowed us to answer new scientific questions and reach deeper insights. 

Surrogate models have  soared in popularity for this reason. In the past, we would use simulations to study physical systems like the turbulence on a wing or the thermodynamics of an engine, but these are expensive to run. Instead, surrogate models use deep learning's impressive ability to learn complex functions to approximate these simulations. By sacrificing some accuracy, we're able to massively accelerate the time to produce a high-fidelity simulation. This enables the analysis of larger and more complex systems. 

For example, hydrological systems are complex, but can be decomposed into multiple modules such as watershed dynamics, river flows, and snow melt. While each one of these modules can be individually simulated, simulating them as a whole demands an enormous amount of computing resources. However, surrogate models make the simulation of this complex system feasible and allow us to make [deeper projections](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS004095). In fact, surrogate models are so successful, they are credited for selecting the experimental conditions that ultimately led to the first fusion experiment that [produced more energy than it consumed](https://www.llnl.gov/article/53316/llnl-used-ai-predict-historic-fusion-ignition-shot). 

Satellite imaging is another area that is experiencing a renaissance. Satellites enable us to peer into every corner of the earth, but it can also be used to [look into the past](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00640). Newer satellites have higher resolution, but because they are newer, they have less historical data. By comparing how two satellites observe the same patch of land, deep learning models can translate low-resolution historical images into sharper versions consistent with what modern satellites would have observed. This means we can reconstruct the past at a level of detail that was never originally captured. 

While much of the discussion on artificial intelligence is focused around automation, not enough is spent on amplification. Yes, our new tools can automate our old tasks, but they can also unlock new possibilities. Scientists of all domains have found innovative applications that expand the frontier of answerable questions. As machine learning continues to mature, the possibilities will only continue to grow.
