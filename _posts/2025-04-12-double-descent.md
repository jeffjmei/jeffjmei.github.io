# Double Descent
The discovery of the descent phenomenon (Belkin, 2019) has upended the classical understanding of bias-variance trade-off. Classical understanding suggests that increasing model complexity inevitably leads to overfitting. A long standing mystery has been why neural networks have such successful generalization performance even when it has been "overfit" on training data. The double descent phenomenon demonstrates that the bias-variance trade-off is incomplete. For low capacity models, the bias-variance trade-off successfully explains generalization performance. However, for high capacity models (e.g. neural networks, random forest, etc.), increasing model complexity often leads to improved generalization error. Consequently, studying over-parameterized models -- models that interpolate the training data to achieve perfect training error -- have been an active field of research.

Recent evidence suggests SGD behaves differently in these over-parameterized contexts than in classical scenarios (Ma, et al., 2018; Belkin, 2021). In particular, whereas SGD tends to reach local minima in classical scenarios, SGD tends to reach global minima in over-parameterized regimes.

Moreover, while SGD with fixed learning rate does not converge in classical scenarios, it converges exponentially in over-parameterized scenarios.

All in all, machine learning theory has long lagged behind our empirical understanding. The double-descent phenomenon and the surprising advantages of over-parameterization are only the first insights into explaining the remarkable success of machine learning models.
